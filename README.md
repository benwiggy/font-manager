# font-manager
Command line utility to activate and de-activate fonts on macOS.


    font-manager register /path/to/font.otf

    font-manager unregister /path/to/font.otf

    font-manager list

Registering a font will make it appear in the font selection panel or menu of all apps. 

The fonts do NOT need to be within the standard OS font folders. 

You can also list all installed (registered) fonts.
