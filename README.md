# font-manager
Command line utility to activate and de-activate fonts on macOS.


font-manager register /path/to/font.otf

font-manager unregister /path/to/font.otf

Registering a font will make it appear in the font selection panel or menu of all apps. (They may need restarting first.)

The fonts do not need to be within the standard OS font folders.
